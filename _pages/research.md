## <font color=RoyalBlue>Research 1: Desktop Gesture Interaction System in Virtual Reality</font>
**Paper :** **Ruisheng Zhang** and Xiaozhou Zhou*. BeyondDeskVR: An Extended Virtual Hand Interaction System in Virtual Reality. _Behaviour & Information Technology_, Under Review. 

- Aim to ensure low fatigue, prolonged, and stable interaction input for a seated working scenario in VR.
- Propose an extended virtual hand interaction system, which integrates desktop and mid-air gesture interactions.
- Prototype a desktop gesture recognition hardware based on infrared laser projection sensing technology.
- Develop a desktop gesture recognition algorithm based on OpenCV, integrating the designed gestures into VR

## <font color=RoyalBlue>Research 2: Hierarchical Human Intention Recognition</font>
- Conduct task analysis and collect operator behavioral datasets for complex flight tasks.
- Develop an 1DCNN+Bi-LSTM+Attention neural network for operator's interaction intention recognition.
- Develop a Dyamic Bayesian Network (DBN) for operator's task intention recognition.
- Achieve simultaneous recognition of dual-level intentions, serving as triggers for intelligent adaptive interfaces.
